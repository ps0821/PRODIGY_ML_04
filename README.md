# Hand Gesture Recognition Model

This project develops a hand gesture recognition model that can accurately identify and classify different hand gestures from image or video data. The goal is to enable intuitive human-computer interaction and gesture-based control systems. The dataset used for this project is sourced from the [LEAP Gesture Recognition](https://www.kaggle.com/gti-upm/leapgestrecog) dataset on Kaggle.

## Introduction
Hand gesture recognition is a valuable technology for various applications, including sign language interpretation, virtual reality interaction, and gaming. This project aims to develop a robust hand gesture recognition model using machine learning techniques.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains images of hand gestures captured by a LEAP Motion controller. The gestures include different hand signs representing letters of the alphabet and other common gestures. The dataset is labeled with the corresponding gesture classes.

You can download the dataset from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/gti-upm/leapgestrecog).

## Installation
To run this project, you need to have Python installed along with the following libraries:
- numpy
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- OpenCV (cv2)

You can install the required libraries using pip:

pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib opencv-python

<h1><b>Usage</b></h1>

**Clone the repository:**

git clone https://github.com/your-username/hand-gesture-recognition.git

**Navigate to the project directory:**

cd hand-gesture-recognition

**Run the gesture_recognition.py script to train the model and classify hand gestures:**

python gesture_recognition.py

<h1><b>Model</b></h1>

The hand gesture recognition model is implemented using machine learning algorithms such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) or support vector machines (SVMs). The key steps involved are:

**Data Preprocessing:** Preprocessing the images (e.g., resizing, normalization) and extracting relevant features.

**Model Training:** Training a machine learning model on the preprocessed image data to classify different hand gestures.

**Model Evaluation:** Evaluating the performance of the trained model using metrics such as accuracy and confusion matrix.

<h1><b>Results</b></h1>

The performance of the hand gesture recognition model is evaluated based on its accuracy in classifying different hand gestures. Visualizations such as confusion matrix and classification reports are used to analyze the results.
